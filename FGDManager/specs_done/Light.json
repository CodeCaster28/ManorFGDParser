If you have multiple lights by the same name, they will count as one additional lightstyle, even if some of the lights are initially dark while others are not. Note that there can be at most 4 different light styles affecting a face in your map. Otherwise, light styles will be discarded from it, causing unrealistic lighting in extreme cases."
