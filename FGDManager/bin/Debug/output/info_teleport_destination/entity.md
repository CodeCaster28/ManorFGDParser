<div class="column entityentry" markdown="1">This is the correct entity to use as the teleport destination entity of a [trigger_teleport](../trigger_teleport). Although other entities such as [info_target](../info_target) can be used as a target as well, only info_teleport_destination allows features such as triggering something on teleport. Setting entity name to displacer_global_target allows for weapon_displacer secondary fire to have players teleport to this info_teleport_destination, if the displacer does not have "Teleport Destination" (m_iszTeleportDestination).</div>

###Keyvalues
<hr>
<div class="entityentry" markdown="1">
<span style="color:#9fc5e8;"><b>OnDestroy Function</b></span> <kbd  class="tooltip" data-tooltip="string">ondestroyfn</kbd> :
Name of the function to use from already parsed .as script files when entity is destroyed (killed) in any way. If the function belongs to namespace, you must use prefix with the namespace name (e.g. mynamespace::MyFunction) for the keyvalue.
</div>
<div class="entityentry" markdown="1">
<span style="color:#9fc5e8;"><b>Name</b></span> <kbd  class="tooltip" data-tooltip="target_source">targetname</kbd> :
Set name of info_teleport_destination so [trigger_teleport](../trigger_teleport) can target it.
</div>
<div class="entityentry" markdown="1">
<span style="color:#9fc5e8;"><b>Target</b></span> <kbd  class="tooltip" data-tooltip="target_destination">target</kbd> :
Entity to trigger when player is teleported to this point, requires "Trigger on Arrival" flag enabled. Sends 'Toggle' signal.
</div>
<div class="entityentry" markdown="1">
<span style="color:#9fc5e8;"><b>Pitch Yaw Roll (X Y Z)</b></span> <kbd  class="tooltip" data-tooltip="string">angles</kbd> :
Where Z means Y and Y means Z, that is, when you're thinking Hammer-grid. (Hammer uses Z for height and Y for depth, while every other sane 3D-application does this the other way round; nonetheless this keyvalue description has the letters in the conventional order) This, technically, is a 3D-vector containing Euler-angles to describe either the entity's rotation or direction of effect. E.g. a func_door_rotating will use this as its initial rotation, while a trigger_push will keep its original alignment and use this for the direction of its push-effect instead. Euler-angles are a hierarchical system to determine an object's orientation in 3D-space. A yaw-value of 0 would mean the entity would face east. (right in top-down view) 90 would mean it would face north. (up in top-down-view) After yaw, pitch is applied. Think aiming up/down with your character in first person. At last, the roll-value is applied. Think your character falling over sideways in first person. Some entities, mostly point entities, do not use the angles keyvalue for any purpose.
</div>
<div class="entityentry" markdown="1">
<span style="color:#9fc5e8;"><b>Teleport Cooldown Delay</b></span> <kbd  class="tooltip" data-tooltip="string">teleport_cooldown</kbd> :
Delay before this destination can be used again after someone landed here.

###Flags
<hr>
<div class="entityflags">
<ul>
<li class="imagepadding" markdown="1"><b>32 </b> : Trigger on arrival : If ticked, info_teleport_destination will trigger it's target whenever an entity is teleported here. The entity is passed as !activator to the info_teleport_destination's target.</li>
<li class="imagepadding" markdown="1"><b>2048 </b> : Not in Deathmatch : Obsolete in Sven Co-op. Makes the entity don't appear in Multiplayer Games.</li>
