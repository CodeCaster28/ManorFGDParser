###Keyvalues
<hr>
<div class="entityentry" markdown="1">
<span style="color:#9fc5e8;"><b>OnDestroy Function</b></span> <kbd  class="tooltip" data-tooltip="string">ondestroyfn</kbd> :
Name of the function to use from already parsed .as script files when entity is destroyed (killed) in any way. If the function belongs to namespace, you must use prefix with the namespace name (e.g. mynamespace::MyFunction) for the keyvalue.
</div>
<div class="entityentry" markdown="1">
<span style="color:#9fc5e8;"><b>Name</b></span> <kbd  class="tooltip" data-tooltip="target_source">targetname</kbd> :
Set name of {{ entname }} so other entities can trigger it.
</div>
<div class="entityentry" markdown="1">
<span style="color:#9fc5e8;"><b>Pitch Yaw Roll (X Y Z)</b></span> <kbd  class="tooltip" data-tooltip="string">angles</kbd> :
Where Z means Y and Y means Z, that is, when you're thinking Hammer-grid. (Hammer uses Z for height and Y for depth, while every other sane 3D-application does this the other way round; nonetheless this keyvalue description has the letters in the conventional order) This, technically, is a 3D-vector containing Euler-angles to describe either the entity's rotation or direction of effect. E.g. a func_door_rotating will use this as its initial rotation, while a trigger_push will keep its original alignment and use this for the direction of its push-effect instead. Euler-angles are a hierarchical system to determine an object's orientation in 3D-space. A yaw-value of 0 would mean the entity would face east. (right in top-down view) 90 would mean it would face north. (up in top-down-view) After yaw, pitch is applied. Think aiming up/down with your character in first person. At last, the roll-value is applied. Think your character falling over sideways in first person. Some entities, mostly point entities, do not use the angles keyvalue for any purpose.

Choices:
</label>
<div class="accordion-body">
<ul>
<li><b>0</b> : Normal : Normal rendering. Entity will receive light, except if it is a sprite. "FX Amount" is obsolete when this is used.</li>
<li><b>1</b> : Color : Brush entities only: Instead of rendering the texture, the whole entity will appear in one color, set by "FX Color". "FX Amount" sets the transparency. 0 means invisible. 255 means fully opaque.</li>
<li><b>2</b> : Texture : Texture-only rendering. Entity will not receive light. Instead, only the texture will be rendered as is. "FX Amount" sets the transparency. 0 means invisible. 255 means fully opaque. This is used for transparent things such as windows. Tip: If you have a window separating a dark and a bright room using only one entity, you can apply a brighter glass texture to the side of the window seen from within the dark room than to the side seen from the bright room. That way, the window's brightness will look realistic from both sides, instead of from just one. Generally, darker rooms require the render amount to be lower, making the glass more transparent, or it would look illogically bright.</li>
<li><b>3</b> : Glow : Sprites only. The sprite will appear in the same size regardless of your distance to it. In addition to that, the further away you are from it, the less visible it will be. (It's only barely visible at about 500 units far away) Good for light coronas. This renders the sprite in additive mode.</li>
<li><b>4</b> : Solid : Brush entities only. All textures of the brush entity starting with '{' will have the last color of their palette (usually blue, black or purple) be rendered fully transparent. This is used for textures with see-through parts, such as grates and railings. Requires "FX Amount" to be set to a value greater than 0, commonly 255.</li>
<li><b>5</b> : Additive : Works just as the "Render Mode" 'Texture', except that the entity's appearance will be added to the background instead of forming a mean. This means, black pixels of textures will be fully transparent, while full-bright pixels are added with a factor of "FX Amount" divided by 255. This is often used for sprites indicating a glowing light, as well as for overlay func_illusionaries to give a computer texture the appearance of having many small, glowing lights, screens and whatever other elements. Render-amount of 255 makes it bright. 0 makes it invisible.</li>

Set the path to a sound replacement file for the weapon. The path begins in 'svencoop/sound/mapname', whereas 'mapname' would be your map's name. You can go to the parent directory using '../'. A valid sound replacement file contains one or more lines with two sound-paths, which are separated by a space and wrapped into quotes. The first sound is the sound to be replaced. The second sound is the new sound. Sound-paths start in the sound directory. You cannot go to the parent directory using '../' in that case. These sounds do not need to be precached using a custom_precache point entity.

HUD weapon sprites override. Custom sprites needs .txt file to be created and placed inside "sprites/<your custom folder>" directory. Content of those text files keeps the same format as other "weapon_X.txt" (where X is the name of the weapon) files inside "/sprites" folder. If you have your sprites text files under "sprites/mymap", the Custom Sprite Directory (this keyvalue) should be set to "mymap". Keep in mind that there must be a text file with name equivalent to this weapon name.

<span style="color:#9fc5e8;"><b>Target</b></span> <kbd  class="tooltip" data-tooltip="target_destination">target</kbd> :
Name of entity to fire (trigger). Which function relates to it depends on the respective entity. Most will just trigger their target, while others will perform actions on their target or use it as a reference for other activities. Often, multiple entities by the same name may be targeted. Most entities need no target, but having one is essential for most logic entities and basic trigger-systems.

<div class="entityentry" markdown="1">
<span style="color:#9fc5e8;"><b>Delay Before Trigger</b></span> <kbd  class="tooltip" data-tooltip="string">delay</kbd> :

Same as target, except that this supposedly causes the specified entity/entities to be removed from the game. Not all entities which have a target to trigger will also handle killtarget. You may want to use a [trigger_relay](../trigger_relay) to make sure it is working.
