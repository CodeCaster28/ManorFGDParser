<div class="column entityentry" markdown="1">Original Half-Life entity that is used to determine a spawnpoint for players. You might want to use [info_player_deathmatch](../info_player_deathmatch) entity for this. This entity is still functional though, it's used when there is no info_player_start nor info_player_dm on map, along with info_player_coop. Note that temporary disabled spawnpoint are counted as disabled- so if all info_player_deathmatch are disabled, and info_player_start available, the players will be spawned on that info_player_start entity. When there is no active or not obstructed spawnpoints, the players are forced to wait until at least one of the spawnpoint become available again.</div>

###Keyvalues
<hr>
<div class="entityentry" markdown="1">
<span style="color:#9fc5e8;"><b>OnDestroy Function</b></span> <kbd  class="tooltip" data-tooltip="string">ondestroyfn</kbd> :
Name of the function to use from already parsed .as script files when entity is destroyed (killed) in any way. If the function belongs to namespace, you must use prefix with the namespace name (e.g. mynamespace::MyFunction) for the keyvalue.
</div>
<div class="entityentry" markdown="1">
<span style="color:#9fc5e8;"><b>Name</b></span> <kbd  class="tooltip" data-tooltip="target_source">targetname</kbd> :
Set name of {{ entname }} so other entities can trigger it.
</div>
<div class="entityentry" markdown="1">
<span style="color:#9fc5e8;"><b>Target</b></span> <kbd  class="tooltip" data-tooltip="target_destination">target</kbd> :
Name of entity to fire (trigger). Which function relates to it depends on the respective entity. Most will just trigger their target, while others will perform actions on their target or use it as a reference for other activities. Often, multiple entities by the same name may be targeted. Most entities need no target, but having one is essential for most logic entities and basic trigger-systems.
</div>
<div class="entityentry" markdown="1">
<span style="color:#9fc5e8;"><b>Pitch Yaw Roll (X Y Z)</b></span> <kbd  class="tooltip" data-tooltip="string">angles</kbd> :
Where Z means Y and Y means Z, that is, when you're thinking Hammer-grid. (Hammer uses Z for height and Y for depth, while every other sane 3D-application does this the other way round; nonetheless this keyvalue description has the letters in the conventional order) This, technically, is a 3D-vector containing Euler-angles to describe either the entity's rotation or direction of effect. E.g. a func_door_rotating will use this as its initial rotation, while a trigger_push will keep its original alignment and use this for the direction of its push-effect instead. Euler-angles are a hierarchical system to determine an object's orientation in 3D-space. A yaw-value of 0 would mean the entity would face east. (right in top-down view) 90 would mean it would face north. (up in top-down-view) After yaw, pitch is applied. Think aiming up/down with your character in first person. At last, the roll-value is applied. Think your character falling over sideways in first person. Some entities, mostly point entities, do not use the angles keyvalue for any purpose.
